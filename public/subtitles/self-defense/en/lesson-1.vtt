00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to the Self-Defense Course
I am your self-defense instructor

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Today we will learn self-defense in confined spaces
Self-protection in elevators, stairwells and other places

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In confined spaces, space is limited
But we can use environmental advantages

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
First, maintain distance from the opponent
Don't let them approach easily

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If the opponent tries to attack
Immediately block with your arms

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Use the wall as support
This can increase the power of counterattack

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Remember, self-defense in confined spaces
The key is to use the environment

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now let's practice these techniques
