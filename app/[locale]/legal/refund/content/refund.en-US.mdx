## 2. Refund Information

### (1) Refund Conditions

You can apply for a refund if the following conditions are met. Specific refund rules vary according to the type of product you purchase:

1. **Course Products** (single courses, such as children's martial arts basic training course, strangle escape technique course, etc.):

   - If you have not watched any course content after purchasing the course (based on the viewing duration recorded in the website backend), you can apply for a full refund within 7 days from the date of purchase;

   - If you have watched part of the course content and the viewing duration does not exceed 20% of the total course duration, you can apply for a partial refund within 7 days from the date of purchase. Refund amount = (1 - viewed duration / total course duration) × course purchase price;

   - If you have watched more than 20% of the total course duration, or more than 7 days have passed since purchase, refund applications will no longer be supported, except in special circumstances (such as serious quality issues with course content, serious inconsistency with course description, etc.), which require website review and confirmation.

2. **Membership Products** (monthly membership, $39.99/month):

   - If you have not used membership benefits (including but not limited to accessing member-exclusive courses, downloading videos, participating in live Q&A, etc.) after activating monthly membership, you can apply for a full refund within 3 days from the date of membership activation;

   - If you have used part of the membership benefits, the refund amount will be calculated according to the proportion of remaining valid days of membership. Refund amount = (remaining valid days of membership / 30) × membership activation price, and the refund application must be submitted within 7 days from the date of membership activation;
